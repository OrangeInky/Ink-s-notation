# Ink-s-notation
My Big number!! Just to show a example lol

definition: 

Ink's array:
x = the value of the term
y = the amount of term
z = the starting expansion value
Write it as (x,y,z)

Written like this: [x,x,x,x...x] w/ y x's.
Rule 1: if the last term is bigger than 0, then the last term subtracts 1, and expands into z+1 amount of x-1;
Rule 2: if the last term is 0, then add 1 to z and the zero is removed.

If anyone can teach me how to make a input box, that would be great!
