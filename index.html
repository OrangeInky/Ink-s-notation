<body>
    Process: <span id="1"> </span> <br>
    Final result : <span id="2"> </span> <br> <br>
</body>
Explanation: <br>
Ink's array: <br>
x = the value of the term <br>
y = the amount of term <br>
z = the starting expansion value <br>
Write it as (x,y,z) <br>
<br>
Written like this: [x,x,x,x...x] w/ y x's. <br>
Rule 1: if the last term is bigger than 0, then the last term subtracts 1, and expands into z+1 amount of x-1; <br>
Rule 2: if the last term is 0, then add 1 to z and the zero is removed. <br>
Use this buy right click and select inspect element, or shift+control+i to open the console. Then use the following functions. (I don't know how to make a input box lol, I am sorry.) <br>
<br><br> Functions: <br> expands(x,y,z), initial value of the array. <br> Calculate() Calculate once; <br> repeater(n), repeatedly calculates the expression, based on n; (DON'T give this function ridiculous numbers)
<br> repeaterrepeater() most of the time will repeat the funciton enough times to goes to the next expansion, (STILL, IF THE ARRAY IS GETTING TOO BIG, DON'T TRY TO USE THIS FUNCTION) <br>
Have a good time playing around with this :)
